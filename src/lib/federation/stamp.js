// Federation write-path stamping helpers (FED-002).
//
// Every write to a replicated config table must bump federation_version and
// set updated_at; deletes become tombstones (deleted=1) instead of hard
// DELETEs so the central's delta endpoint can propagate them to edges.
//
// Version semantics — CRITICAL for delta correctness:
//   federation_version = global watermark + 1 on EVERY write (insert, update,
//   delete). The watermark is max(federation_version) across the 7 physical
//   tables. Stamping to watermark+1 (rather than row version + 1) guarantees
//   every change is strictly newer than anything an edge has seen, so the
//   delta query `federation_version > since` (since = edge's last applied
//   watermark) delivers every change exactly once. Without this, a row whose
//   version lags the watermark (e.g. created at v1 while another table is at
//   v2) would produce a tombstone/update at v2 — NOT > the edge's watermark
//   v2 — and the change would be silently lost forever.
//
// The watermark query is a MAX over 7 small config tables — microseconds per
// write, acceptable for a config DB. Writes inside one transaction see each
// other's uncommitted versions (SQLite), so versions stay strictly increasing
// within a batch.
